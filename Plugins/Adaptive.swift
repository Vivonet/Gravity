// TODO: add support for a sizeClass attribute and registering size classes as ranges of horizontal and vertical sizes.
// the ranges shouldn't need to be contiguous: we should snap to the most-applicable size class
// we should also support adaptive design by allowing completely different layouts for different size classes (not just different attributes within one layout)
