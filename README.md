#Gravity
A simple XML-based layout description language for iOS powered by Auto Layout and written in Swift.

**tl;dr** It's kinda like HTML for apps and is *infinitely* easier to use than Auto Layout. Literally infinitely. I measured it.

##Sample
Here's what some actual functioning Gravity looks like:

```xml
<H gravity="middle" color="#fff">
	<V gravity="top left">
		<UILabel id="titleLabel" text="1188 W Georgia St" maxWidth="250" font="System Semibold 16" textColor="#ffffff" wrap="true"/>
		<UILabel id="hoursLabel" text="Open today: 6am - 11pm" font="System 14.0" textColor="#ffffff7f"/>
		<UIView height="6"/>
		<H gravity="middle" spacing="0" height="28" color="#ffffff">
			<UIButton id="carButton" backgroundColor="#0076FF" minWidth="80">
				<H alignment="center" userInteractionEnabled="false">
					<UIView width="4"/>
					<UIImageView width="22" height="22" image="Directions-Car"/>
					<UIView width="2"/>
					<UILabel text="12 mins" font="System Bold 16.0"/>
					<UIView width="4"/>
				</H>
			</UIButton>
			<UIView width="6"/>
			<UIButton id="walkButton" backgroundColor="#0076FF">
				<H alignment="center" userInteractionEnabled="false">
					<UIView width="4"/>
					<UIImageView width="22" height="22" image="Directions-Walk"/>
					<UIView width="2"/>
					<UILabel text="22 mins" font="System Bold 16.0"/>
					<UIView width="4"/>
				</H>
			</UIButton>
		</H>
	</V>
	<UIView width="8"/>
	<UIView>
		<UIButton width="64" backgroundColor="#ffffff00">
			<V alignment="center">
				<UIImageView image="chevron-right-bold"/>
				<UILabel text="Order" color="#fff"/>
			</V>
		</UIButton>
	</UIView>
</H>
```

##Introduction
In my thirty-five years of existence in this universe, I have encountered few things as brutally frustrating as Apple's Auto Layout engine. For a company that prides itself in the intuitiveness and ease of use of their software, Auto Layout represents a complete 180Â° on that stance, instead favouring bizarre and unnatural complexity over simplicity of design. The result is a beast of a system that takes many long hours to become even remotely proficient in.

Auto Layout has its apologists, and while there's no arguing it's a powerful system, the fact remains that if you've ever had to work with Auto Layout at some point in your career, you're all but guaranteed to have had a frustrating experience.

Auto layout tends to work well in two scenarios:

1. Extremely simple layouts, and
2. Extremely complex layouts.

It fails though, utterly in my opinion, at handling 99% of the layouts typical in modern software: those that need slightly more power than the absolute basic defaults, but which are not so mind-numbingly complex as to require the type of prioritized constraint engine Auto Layout is based upon (especially when 99% of its use is to resize a view from one screen size to a subtly different screen size).

Here's my background: I've always been a Mac guy, but I dabbled with .NET for a while in the mid 2000's. During this time I discovered (and eventually fell quite in love with) WPF, a.k.a. Windows Presentation Foundation. WPF represented a quantum leap forward in the natural expressibility of visual layouts using a simple hierarchical structure it called XAML. Horrible, horrible names. Apparently WPF was called by the codename of Avalon. And they changed it to WPF. Like WPF were they thinking. I digress.

After leaving the Windows world and coming back to Apple by means of the iOS platform, I was utterly dismayed at the mediocre layout tools available to me: at first it was Interface Builder with springs and struts. While the springs and struts model was a breeze to understand and worked fairly well for very simple interfaces, it was ultimately very limited in what it could express. But it wasn't until Apple released their "next big thing" in layout that things got truly bad.

"Auto Layout," they called it, as if it were some tongue-in-cheek sarcastic jab. Truly there is nothing "auto" about it. It is in fact painstakingly manual. Now, instead of simply telling the computer which edges of an element should flow and which should be fixed in place, you have to tie individual edges of elements to each other, and chain these bindings together in precisely the right arrangement, for fear of not supplying all the required constraints, or supplying too many and having ambiguous or conflicting constraints, all the while having many more things to have to worry about: (constraint priorities, content hugging, compression resistance, user constraints, system constraints, implicitly generated constraints, placeholder constraints, etc., etc.). Things went from simple but limited to insanely complex overnight.

Anyway if you've made it this far I'm probably preaching to the choir.

The *good* news is that Auto Layout is now sufficiently powerful enough to act as the foundation for another much-simpler layer built on top of it. Enter: Gravity.

Why "Gravity"?

Well, gravity is simple. It's a law: things attract. Gravity is the universe's way of optimizing space, just like your interface elements will automatically size and shrink to their ideal size and will just automatically look good and behave like you want.

Go ahead, sketch out a simple UI on a piece of paper or your favourite app. Looking at it, you already have a good idea of which elements should expand or shrink, and which elements should collapse before other elements. It's usually pretty obvious. Gravity aims to turn that intuitive knowledge into a functioning UI with as little work as possible.

Gravity is inspired on the surface by WPF, but is a much much simpler take on it. You define an interface as a tree: everything has its place in the hierarchy and the resultant interface is generated programmatically with all of the proper layout constraints in place, so you get all the power of auto layout without even having to touch it. (Although you *can* touch it if you want to. It's all still there. Gravity isn't a black box.)

Gravity is really a layout engine for programmers who prefer the precision and control of a code file over loosey goosey mousework. Unlike Interface Builder, which presents you with a visualization of your software and requires you to build and tweak that interface graphically, Gravity lets you tweak your interface *textually*, just like editing source code. Yeah you have to rebuild and run to see your changes, but the control and precision it gives you is worth it. It's also far, far harder to accidentally do something unintended and end up breaking your entire UI. Interface builder is fragile like that. Gravity aims to be a solid mathematical foundation for your app's interface.

Another bonus? Because Gravity's syntax is so much simpler than a XIB file, things like source control diffs are so much more readable.

Gravity is more than just a layout language. Gravity is a metaphor. For the way we picture and convey the information we want to display to our users. It is minimalism and efficiency.

Calling Gravity an "engine" is a bit of a stretch. Auto Layout is still the true engine powering Gravity. Gravity just gives you a much simpler way to specify your interface, and Auto Layout takes care of the heavy lifting behind the scenes. It's really just an interpretive layer that converts an XML document into a fully-constructed interface. Gravity is the curtain that hides the great and powerful Oz.

Coming soon.

##The Philosophy
Constructing an interface is a way of communicating. It is a way for the developer of an application to communicate relevant contextual information to the user. It shouldn't be something that is hard or takes painstaking work. It should be as natural as language: as thoughts arranged in such a way as to be understood.

Apple seems to treat interface development as a finely tuned work of art. A masterpiece of balancing cards. And while there's nothing wrong with a perfected UI, the order of magnitude longer time it takes to develop could easily be argued away in a great many cases.

##The Basics
###Growing and Shrinking
In regular Auto Layout, you control how elements expand and contract by a combination of **content hugging priority** and **content compression resistance priority**, each of which (being a priority) takes a value between 0 and 1000.

In Gravity, things are much simpler to wrap your head around. You simply specify the order in which elements in a container should collapse and which element should grow. Positive numbers mean first, negative numbers mean last. So if you want an element to be the first to grow* when there is extra space, set grows="1". If you want it to be the last to shrink when there is not enough room, shrinks="-1". You can order as many or as few as you want.

* *Technically only one element can ever grow, due to current limitations.*

Like so:

```xml
<H>
	<UILabel text="I am just a label:" shrinks="1"/>
	<UILabel text="I am important content." shrinks="-2" grows="1"/>
	<UIImage id="statusIcon" image="exclamation-22" shrinks="-1"/>
</H>
```

Given the above layout, it's easy to see that the label will be the first thing to shrink when space gets tight, and the status icon (which is apprently quite important) will be the last thing to go. If there is extra space, it will all go to the middle content label.

Perhaps you want the label to shrink, but only to a point. If you set a minWidth on the label, that will have a higher constraint priority and block the element from shrinking any further.

Unfortunately, I haven't figured out how to get UIStackView to grow or shrink multiple elements equally together. This was really the intended design, but unfortunately doesn't appear to be possible just yet and the stack view seems to always just choose the last element.

##Tips
Gravity is not just an easier way to work with Auto Layout, it's really a whole philosophy: Build your interfaces from the inside-out, not the outside-in. Let the content be key. Don't waste space.

###Gravity
Gravity (that is the "gravity" attribute) is a **scoped attribute** that controls the general direction of attraction for elements in the interface. It applies to its entire subtree until overridden by a different child value. ("color" is another scoped attribute. You can use it to set the default foreground color of all elements in a subtree, including templated UIImageViews.)

Gravity primarily affects the *containers* (the <H> and <V> stack views), but it can be applied to any node in your tree. So you must change the gravity of an element's parent container if you want to affect how that element is aligned within it. Gravity may, however, also affect certain views if they implement custom handlers. For example, text elements like UILabel adjust their justification to follow the gravity (including GravityDirection.Wide, which becomes Justified).

Gravity does not presently have any effect on UIViews, because UIViews simply match the size of their content so there is nothing to align.

##Q&A
**Q: Isn't a XIB file already XML? Why do I need another XML format?**

**A:** The answer has to do with the intended purpose of the XML and how it is utilized. Yes, XIB files are XML-based, but they're XML-based as a *serialization format*, not as a language with a user experience. XIB files are not intended to be authored by hand. Gravity, on the other hand, is designed from the ground up to be written by hand and is therefore intentionally simple and concise. Furthermore, XIB's XML format does absolutely nothing to abstract away the pains of Auto Layout. So even if you were to attempt to author a XIB file by hand (seriously though, don't), you'd still be programming with Auto Layout, albeit in a different form. Gravity is an abstraction layer built on top of Auto Layout. XIB is just Interface Builder serialized to XML.

**Q: Doesn't the strictness of the hierarchy restrict the interfaces you can create?**

**A:** Yes, this is a natural result of what Gravity is. You'd be surprised how perfectly it works out in many cases, and when you start to think like Gravity, you start to design like Gravity. Interfaces build themselves from the inside-out. Like I said, it's a philosophy too. It's not going to be for everyone.

**Q: Is there design-time support for Gravity?**

**A:** Not yet, but this is definitely something I would like to do. I am not sure what is possible and what not at this point. Please contribute if you have any ideas.

**Q: Does Gravity support OS X development?**

**A:** Not yet, but I don't expect this would be too difficult. I just don't have any experience with AppKit on OS X, but I expect it will be very possible to port/extend Gravity to OS X in the near future.

##Requirements
Gravity makes heavy use of the `UIStackView`, so iOS 9 only, I'm afraid! This is brand spankin' new stuff!
